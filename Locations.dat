Porch
The front of the mansion is moderately dilapidated. It looks like it is inhabitable, but would leak during any sort of precipitation. The porch has a few wooden columns; their paint is peeling, revealing the sun-bleached wood beneath. The floorboards are warped and their paint is also peeling. The door itself is made of a dark oak, and is in very good condition, which makes it stand out from its surroundings.
